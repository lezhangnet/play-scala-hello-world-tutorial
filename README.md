MOVED TO https://github.com/playframework/play-samples

NOTE from lezhangnet 20200101
The original base repo (https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-hello-world-tutorial) is archived and moved into "play-samples" (https://github.com/playframework/play-samples/tree/2.8.x/play-scala-hello-world-tutorial), which is a collection of a LOT of projects.
So I decided to maintain this myself just to keep a short and concise hello world project.
